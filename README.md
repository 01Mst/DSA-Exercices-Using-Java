## Introduction

This repository is a resource for anyone interested in learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with DSA or an experienced programmer wanting to refresh your knowledge, you'll find something valuable here.

## Languages

I practiced and using Java as my primary language in problem solving.

## Content

Here's what you can expect to find in this repository:

1. **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks,.

2. **Algorithms**: Various algorithm implementations, including sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).

3. **Problem Solving**: Solutions to algorithmic problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank.

4. **Tutorials**: Tutorials and articles explaining DSA concepts and techniques.
